# hello-world
## This is my first "Hello World"
### Story time
On the 2nd of June 2022 I will be starting my front-end course for beginners and I am really **excited** to beggin. The course will be held by [CodeAcademy.lt](https://codeacademy.lt/) lecturers and I really hope that it will help me develop and push me forard on this adventure. At the moment I'm working as a Sales Manager but I really want to change my career and explore the vasat possibilities of coding. What I excpect after finnishing this course:
1. Having a better understanding of what coding is;
2. Building a portfolio;
3. Hopefully getting a job as a junior front-end developer.
